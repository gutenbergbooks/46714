<h2><a name="ABSTRACT_OF_THE_DISSERTATION" id="ABSTRACT_OF_THE_DISSERTATION">ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION</a></h2>

<p>1. What was attempted?</p>

<p>Attempt was made to study organic selenium compounds of
the heterocyclic series in reference to those properties leading
to tinctorial and pharmaceutical possibilities.</p>

<p class="p2">2. What were the methods of attack?</p>

<p>(a) Organic selenium compounds were reviewed and their
properties examined critically with those of allied compounds.</p>

<p>(b) Some new heterocyclic compounds of selenium were
studied and their characteristic properties more closely examined
along the desired line.</p>

<p class="p2">3. In how far were the attempts successful?</p>

<p>The literature was reviewed and classified with reference to
the properties under consideration, and new selenium organic compounds
were prepared and studied which it is hoped may throw
some additional light upon the problem.</p>

<p class="p2">4. What contribution actually new to the science of chemistry
has been made?</p>

<p>(a) Compounds newly made have been shown to exhibit a
distinct tinctorial value in comparison with their analogues.</p>

<p>(b) They have been shown to be chemically easier to handle
than the corresponding sulphur compounds.</p>

<p>(c) Selenium, in the nucleus of cyclic compounds, has been
shown to be instrumental for a positive coloration at least equal
to the &mdash;NH&mdash; or &mdash;S&mdash; groupings. The selenocarbonyl, :C:Se,
has been shown to be a more powerful chromophore than thiocarbonyl,
:C:S, or carbonyl itself, :C:O.</p>

<p>(d) Two series of azo dyes of selenium have been prepared
and have been shown to possess a marked tinctorial value.</p>

<p>(e) The following new compounds have been prepared:</p>

<ul><li>2-methyl-4-selenoquinazolone</li>

<h2><a name="PURPOSE_OF_THE_RESEARCH" id="PURPOSE_OF_THE_RESEARCH">PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH</a></h2>

<p>Since Berzelius published the first resume of the chemistry
of selenium, in 1818<a href="#bib_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>, many articles have appeared in this
field. Several reviews<a href="#bib_2" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> of its compounds, including references,
have been published, besides the resumes in the chemical dictionaries.
These reviews are confined mainly to the inorganic side.
No attempt has ever been made to compile a bibliography of
selenium organic compounds.</p>

<p>From time to time, articles have appeared, but the field is
still a promising one, with many alluring possibilities.</p>

<p>In the perusal of the organic records of the metal, distributed
over the span of a century, there are indications of the value of
selenium compounds for pharmaceutical and tinctorial uses.
An effort has been made to collect these scattered data for critical
examination with other analogues and sulphur compounds
in particular, and to prepare and study some new organic compounds
containing selenium, for the purpose of gaining additional
light upon the chemistry of such substances, and in the
hope of discovering some which may be of practical service
in medicine or elsewhere.</p>

2-phenylbenzoselenazole and Its
Derivatives</a></h2>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>The general conception of selenium is that it is a comparatively
rare element. Few realize that it has been known for
over a century and that over twenty selenium minerals, containing
from one to sixty-six per cent. of the metal, are considered by
the mining corporations as important. Beside being a by-product
of sulphuric acid manufacture, it is separated also in the
electrolytic refining of copper. The demand for the metal is so
small that there are half a dozen concerns in the United States
either willing to supply gratis any reasonable quantity for research
work, or to sell it at cost. In a special report of the
National Research Council on selenium<a href="#bib_3" class="fnanchor">(3)</a>, it is estimated that
there could be produced annually, without making any material
additions to the present plants, not less than 300,000 pounds.</p>

<p>In fact selenium has, in recent years, gradually been brought
more and more to the attention of the general public through
its application to military uses and other purposes. In the glass
industry, for example, it was used as decolorizer during the
War period. It has been found that it imparts a violet red tint
to the pyrex tubing after the latter has been used for a few combustions.
The coloration is especially noticeable when a broken
piece is examined. This may find an important place in the
ceramic industry. In turning off the gas light of the city at
day break, in controlling the draft of the factory chimneys, and
in regulating the rapidity of the manufacture of sulphuric acid,
the selenium cell is an important labor saving factor. In a
similar way it is used in automatically lighting and extinguishing
light buoys. It also finds application in photometry, wireless
telephony, military telegraphy, and army signaling as well as
for the transmission of signatures, handwritings, finger prints,
and images in general<a href="#bib_3" class="fnanchor">(3)</a><a href="#bib_4" class="fnanchor">(4)</a>.</p>

<p>The question of the vulcanization of rubber also should be
considered. Some experiments have been published claiming the
similarity of the action of selenium and sulphur on rubber<a href="#bib_4" class="fnanchor">(4)</a><a href="#bib_5" class="fnanchor">(5)</a>.
The cost need not be prohibitive, since the supply could be
easily increased and the price reduced provided there were a
demand. In the personal experience of the writer, when working
with the hydrogen selenide gas, the rubber connections of
the apparatus soon turned red, and after a few hours were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
clear a red that visitors to the laboratory imagined that the writer
was using the ordinary red rubber connections. The rubber
thus changed seems to be softer and more elastic than the
original; this observation will be followed up.</p>

<p>In this country the National Research Council has created
a special committee of seven to investigate the various possible
uses of selenium and tellurium.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="PHARMACOLOGICAL_REVIEW" id="PHARMACOLOGICAL_REVIEW">PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEW</a></h2>

<p>Duhamel and Rebiere<a href="#bib_6" class="fnanchor">(6)</a><a href="#bib_7" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> showed that an injection of a
trace of red colloidal selenium into rabbits increased urea excretion
regularly. In other cases satisfactory results were claimed
and the liver showed some lesions. The histological modifications
produced by injections into rabbits are most apparent
in the liver and kidneys. In the distribution of colloidal preparations
in the animal body by injection, Duhamel and Juillard<a href="#bib_8" class="fnanchor">(8)</a>
found that the liver contained the greatest amount. Six
years later the former<a href="#bib_9" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> used a similar preparation introduced
into the animal intravenously, and selenium was again found
in the liver, although in smaller quantity.</p>

<p>Sulphur compounds have similar physiological action. It
is known that triphenylstibine sulphide, or sulphoform,
(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>SbS, has a curative effect in skin diseases, as it liberates
&ldquo;nascent&rdquo; sulphur on the skin. It is equally natural to expect
some organic selenium compound which liberates finely divided
selenium to exert a remedial influence on animal bodies. The
selenoquinazolone prepared in the course of this research and described
more fully in another section of the paper, has this prospect.
The quinazolone has the following structure:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i008.png" width="112" height="91" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Experiments were carried on at L&rsquo;Institut Pasteur in Paris
under the supervision of M. Borel for the treatment of cancer in
mice. No human subjects were experimented upon, although results
were claimed by using selenides and their oxidized salts.</p>

<p>Selenium dyes were found to be medicinals, although no
relation has yet been established between constitution of these
organic dyes and their therapeutic value. Wassermann<a href="#bib_10" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> made
several eosin preparations, by coupling the sodium derivative
with potassium selenocyanide. The red dyestuff thus prepared
is stated to be easily soluble in water. Wassermann, Keysser
and Wassermann<a href="#bib_11" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> made experiments with it, chemotherapeutically,
on animal tumors. When the solution was injected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
into mice tumors the latter turned red, accompanied by the softening
of the tumor after the third injection and complete resorption
after ten injections, unless the dose used was too great for
the animal. In that case death often occurred. Good results
were also reported, in connection with this experiment, on four
different strains of mouse carcinoma and one strain of mouse
sarcoma. In the latter case, relief was found sooner but the
former disappeared more slowly. Another preparation was made
later<a href="#bib_12" class="fnanchor">(12)</a> and introduced into mice intravenously and again found
to have good results.</p>

<p>The following is the structure of 2-selenocyanideanthraquinone&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i009a.png" width="161" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p>which has also been reported to have medicinal uses<a href="#bib_13" class="fnanchor">(13)</a>.</p>

<p>P. Ehrlich and Hugo Bauer<a href="#bib_14" class="fnanchor">(14)</a> synthesized from p.p&#697;-diamino-diphenyl-methane
the red dye 3,6-diaminoselenopyronine.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i009b.png" width="186" height="81" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The dye has been used upon mice and caused pronounced edema.
The toxicity of both the selenopyronine and the corresponding
sulphur compound was compared under similar conditions in
the same experiment, and it was found that the selenium dye was
toxic in 1/3000 gram, but the sulphur dye was toxic in 1/2500
gram per twenty gram weight of the animal.</p>

<p>This physiological activity was noted years ago with the
inorganic compounds of selenium and Berzelius<a href="#bib_15" class="fnanchor">(15)</a> described
the poisonous effect of hydrogen selenide quite impressively;
&ldquo;In order to get acquainted with the smell of this gas I allowed
a bubble not larger than a pea to pass into my nostril; in consequence
of its smell I so completely lost my sense of smell for
several hours that I could not distinguish the odor of strong
ammonia even when held under my nose. My sense of smell
returned after five or six hours, but severe irritation of the
mucous membrane set in and persisted for a fortnight.&rdquo; The
writer has been working on the gas for some time and was
also quite seriously affected once, the injury persisting for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
days. That it is more poisonous than the hydrogen sulphide is
well known.</p>

<p>Bruere<a href="#bib_16" class="fnanchor">(16)</a> showed that when hydrogen sulphide was passed
into blood solution sulphemoglobin was produced in considerable
quantity, due to the chemical action of sulphur and hematin. He
stated further that sulphemoglobin may be found in animal blood
when a large amount of the gas has been inhaled. He made
selenhemoglobin in the same manner. Sixteen years later, Clarke
and Hurtley also proved that selenhemoglobin may be made by
passing hydrogen selenide into blood<a href="#bib_17" class="fnanchor">(17)</a>. These experiments
may be interpreted to mean that the oxy-hemoglobin is transformed
into an organic complex of sulphur or selenium, and that
the transference may be more rapid and powerful in the case of
hydrogen selenide.</p>

<p>Biological investigations have sufficiently proved that dyestuffs
of the phenazine, oxazine, thiazine, acridine series show
an injurious effect on protozoa, especially those dyes containing
substituted amino groupings and of a simple structure<a href="#bib_18" class="fnanchor">(18)</a>. In
the case of the thiazine dyes of the methylene blue class, the
physiological importance has well recognized in their use as
feeble antiseptics and analgesics. Ehrlich and Guttmann<a href="#bib_19" class="fnanchor">(19)</a>
initiated the use of methylene blue as an antiperiodic and its
use in that line has been continued.</p>

<p>In the field of the selenazine dyes, pharmacologists have not
yet paid much attention to them, on account of the newness of
the discovery, but P. Karrer claims that they are indisputably
&ldquo;vital dyestuffs&rdquo;<a href="#bib_20" class="fnanchor">(20)</a>. The prospect of synthesizing selenazine
dyes and their use as drugs seems to be bright, judging from the
fact that they are easily prepared and capable of many combinations,
especially of the ease with which they form organic
complexes with arsenic compounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i010.png" width="600" height="106" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Formula (I) is known, as 1, 3-dinitrobenzoselenazine<a href="#bib_21" class="fnanchor">(21)</a>, which
was obtained by the action of picryl chloride on the zinc salt
of o-aminoselenophenol; the product (picrylaminoselenophenol)
being then treated with alkali and thus converted to the dye,
which upon experimentation showed marked effects upon protozoa
and bacteria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i011a.png" width="600" height="309" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Formula (II), known as 3-(p-phenylarsonic)-aminoselenazine,
is red in dilute alkali and green in mineral acid, and is a typical
dye in a series from the coupling of selenodiphenylamine with
arsenic compounds. All possess similar toxicity as the thiazine
dyes<a href="#bib_20" class="fnanchor">(20)</a>. Other selenazines are listed in the bibliography<a href="#bib_22" class="fnanchor">(22)</a>.</p>

<p>No less than half dozen thioureas are commonly used as
drugs. Thiourea itself paralyzes the nerve centers, and is employed
commercially for photograph fixing and for removing
stains from negatives; thiuret, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, serves as a substitute
for iodoform; thiosinamine-ethyliodide, or tiodine, IH<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>NCSNHC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>,
is used for relief of lesions of the central nervous
system; allylthiourea or thiosinamine, (NH<sub>2</sub>)SC.NHCH<sub>2</sub>CH:CH<sub>2</sub>,
for aiding the absorption of connective tissues, for treatment
of burns, keloids, urethral diseases, sclerotic conditions of
the ear<a href="#bib_23" class="fnanchor">(23)</a>.</p>

<p>Selenocarbamide and a number of its derivatives have been
prepared and studied. One class of seleno ureas has been
patented as pharmaceutical products by Chem. Fabrik von Heyden<a href="#bib_24" class="fnanchor">(24)</a>,
and are prepared by the action of hydrogen selenide
on alkylcyanamides,</p>

<p class="center">RNH.CHN + H<sub>2</sub>Se = RNH.CSe.NH<sub>2</sub>
</p>

<p>They possess pronounced therapeutic value and, serve as intermediate
products in the production of more stable alkyl halide
additive compounds. Other carbamides ranging from seleno
urea itself<a href="#bib_25" class="fnanchor">(25)</a>, (III) and a cyclic urea<a href="#bib_26" class="fnanchor">(26)</a> (IV) are described
in the literature:</p>

<div class="figgroup">
<img src="images/i011b.png" width="189" height="80" alt="" />
<img src="images/i011c.png" width="248" height="71" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The latter, known as ethylene-selenourea, may be classified also
in the azole group as 2-iminotetrahydroselenazole (V).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i012a.png" width="205" height="134" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The literature for the other normal carbamides is listed in the
bibliography<a href="#bib_27" class="fnanchor">(27)</a>.</p>

<p>Selenoantipyrines, selenosaccharine, selenoindigoes have
also been prepared.</p>

<p>Thiophene and its derivatives are of considerable therapeutic
interest. Thiophene itself is found to be useful in lessening the
elimination of sulphuric acid in urine, and is employed in the
dermatological practice. Sodium thiophene sulphonate, thiophenetetra-bromide,
thiophene diiodide, are all medicinals<a href="#bib_23" class="fnanchor">(23)</a>.</p>

<p>A number of selenophenes are recorded in the literature.
Their relation to the selenazoles may be easily seen from the
following formulas:</p>

<div class="figgroup">
<div class="figcenter ilb">
<img src="images/i012b.png" width="122" height="158" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Selenophene</p>

<div class="figcenter ilb">
<img src="images/i012c.png" width="109" height="158" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Selenazole</p>
</div></div>

<p>Dimethyl selenophene was prepared from acetonyl acetone
and phosphorous pentaselenide,</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i012d.png" width="527" height="137" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The compound thus obtained is stated to have the same odor
as thiophene, but no mention is made in regard to its uses<a href="#bib_28" class="fnanchor">(28)</a>.
Selenophene was prepared from sodium succinate and phosphorous
triselenide, or by conducting ethylselenide through hot
tubes<a href="#bib_29" class="fnanchor">(29)</a>.</p>

<p>Some selenazoles find application also in medicine. At present
only the isoazoles are known to have physiological uses. One
of them was prepared from anthraquinone selenocyanide, by the
action of ammonia under pressure<a href="#bib_30" class="fnanchor">(30)</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i013a.png" width="600" height="147" alt="" />

<p>Another type of azoles, benzoselendiazole (piaselenol) and five
of its derivatives, have been also described as medicinals<a href="#bib_31" class="fnanchor">(31)</a>.
The diazole itself has the following structure,</p>

<p>Sulphides and disulphides have curative power. Dimethylsulphide
is used for internal treatment, di-o-aminophenyldisulphide
is used for intramuscular injections. Diallyl sulphide
is also a medicament. Methyl selenide has some effect on the
internal parts of the body<a href="#bib_33" class="fnanchor">(33)</a>. Hanzlik and Tarr<a href="#bib_34" class="fnanchor">(34)</a> at the
American University Experimental Station, showed that a number
of selenium compounds act as skin irritants: e.g., dichlorodiethyl
selenide, dichlorovinyl selenide, trichlorodiethyl selenide
and selenium mustard oil. The first mentioned proved as potent
as the sulphide, but the others fell somewhat below in their effects.
Diantipyryl selenide is another therapeutical agent<a href="#bib_35" class="fnanchor">(35)</a>.</p>

<p>The diselenides occupy an important place of their own.
The selenophenols do not remain unchanged in the air, but are
always oxidized to the diselenides, which can be again reduced
to the selenophenols. So far only the diselenides of anthraquinone
and their phenols are recognized remedies<a href="#bib_36" class="fnanchor">(36)</a>.</p>

<p>Diethyl selenide (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Se, is a yellowish heavy oil of unpleasant

<p>It would be most natural to conclude that the chromophore :CS
is more powerful than :CO, and that :CSe is most powerful of
all, as shown in our study of quinazoline compounds. It would
equally follow that :S is a more powerful color-forming radical
in a cyclic compound than that of :O; and :NH than that of
:S; and :Se again most powerful of the whole series.</p>

<p>Lesser and Weiss<a href="#bib_41" class="fnanchor">(41)</a> in their research on selenoindigo
stated that the selenium dyestuff, on account of its greater molecular
weight than sulphur, shows a deeper blue. This hypothesis
meets a difficulty in the case of coumorandione, thionaphthenequinone
and isatin series, where the -NH- radical has an atomic
weight of 15, and -S- 32, and showed the reversed order of color.
This seems to be the case in the selenophene series also. Therefore
this theory is not without exceptions.</p>

<p>The diselenides present a very interesting study also.
Methyl disulphide is colorless, but methyldiselenide<a href="#bib_42" class="fnanchor">(42)</a> is a
reddish yellow liquid. Methyl disulphide only becomes yellow
when it is treated with chlorine, and in such cases (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>
is formed<a href="#bib_43" class="fnanchor">(43)</a>, in yellow rhombic crystals. Ethyldisulphide is
colorless: ethyldisulphidedichloride is a faint yellow oil<a href="#bib_44" class="fnanchor">(44)</a>.
But the corresponding ethyldiselenide is a red liquid<a href="#bib_45" class="fnanchor">(45)</a>. Phenyl
disulphide is colorless, and phenyldisulphide dibromide is of
mother-of-pearl appearance, and practically colorless<a href="#bib_46" class="fnanchor">(46)</a>, while
phenyl diselenide forms pure yellow needles<a href="#bib_47" class="fnanchor">(47)</a>, and phenyldiselenide
dibromide orange red ones.</p>

<p>While phenyldisulphide is colorless, when an auxochrome
group is added, such as NH<sub>2</sub>, the compound is colored. This is
the case with o-diaminodiphenyldisulphide<a href="#bib_48" class="fnanchor">(48)</a> which is yellow
both in solution and in crystalline form. In other words, an auxochrome
in addition to the chromophore group transforms a colorless
chromogen into a colored one. Therefore groups like
-S.S- and -Se.Se- are chromophores in the same sense as -N:N-.
This is in agreement with the chromophore ideas of Hugo Kaufmann.
The -Se.Se- is a more powerful chromophore than
-S.S-.</p>

<p>This brings one directly to the inquiry as to why 2-phenylbenzoselenazole,
which contains a :Se radical, should be colorless;
and that even 6-nitro-2-phenylselenazole, with the addition
of a chromophore NO<sub>2</sub>, should be only faintly colored. The
benzothiazoles, their isomers and derivatives are mostly colorless,
and similar causes are probably responsible in the case of the
phenylbenzoselenazole, for its lack of color. But when this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
selenazole is combined with another chromophore, for example
an azomethine grouping, the result is a more positively colored
compound (in this case benzalaminoselenazole), the crystals
being yellow. The corresponding thiazole derivative is light
colored.</p>

<p>The tinctorial value of the selenium derivative is further
evidenced by the ease with which it forms azo dyes and the deep
colors of the latter. This was observed when 6-amino-2-phenylbenzoselenazole
was diazotized and coupled with B-naphthol,
salicylic acid, etc. The corresponding aminothiazole has been considered
difficult to diazotize, on account of its insolubility in hydrochloric
acid, cold or hot, but the aminoselenazole dissolves readily
and completely, the coupling is almost instantaneous, and the dyes
obtained are mostly red and of metallic lustre. In view of the
stability of benzoselenazoles toward hot concentrated acids (with
the exception of nitric, when nitration ensues) and alkalis, these
dyes may prove of some commercial interest.</p>

<p>The azole dyes of the benzoselenazole have been exposed to
light for weeks, and also exposed to acids and alkalis, and have
been found to be quite fast.</p>

<p>Busch prepared quinazolines by the action of o-amino or

carbon disulphide<a href="#bib_51" class="fnanchor">(51)</a>:</p>

</div>

<p>Accordingly the same reaction was tried with o-nitrobenzylamine,
prepared by the method of Lellmann and Stickel<a href="#bib_50" class="fnanchor">(50)</a>,
using carbon diselenide<a href="#bib_51" class="fnanchor">(51)</a>. The reaction seemed to work, but
the mixture formed was difficult to extract and it appeared that
other reactions took place at the same time, due to the impurity
of the carbon diselenide, as the latter has never been prepared
in the pure state.</p>

<p>Another method, which is equally attractive because of its
simplicity, is that of Gabriel and Stelzner<a href="#bib_52" class="fnanchor">(52)</a>,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with the above reaction o-aminobenzaldehyde
should work with equal ease with selenocarbamide, but the initial
materials were not available.</p>

<p>The reaction which was used successfully was that of
Bogert, Breneman and Hand<a href="#bib_53" class="fnanchor">(53)</a>,</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The hydrogen selenide used in the reaction was prepared from
FeSe by the action of hydrochloric acid, or by heating paraffin and
selenium, in the proportion of four to one respectively, at 335°
to 350°C<a href="#bib_54" class="fnanchor">(54)</a>.</p>

<p>The selenoquinazoline was prepared from anthranilic nitrile
by the following methods&mdash;the anthranilic nitrile being prepared
from o-nitraniline<a href="#bib_57" class="fnanchor">(57)</a>,</p>

<p>(a) 20 grams of acetyl-anthranilic nitrile was dissolved in
absolute alcohol, and dry hydrogen selenide and dry ammonia
passed into the solution for three hours. The quinazoline crystallized
out gradually on cooling was filtered out and recrystallized
from dilute alcohol. The yield was about ten per cent.</p>

<p>(b) 10 grams of acetyl-anthranilic nitrile was heated in
a sealed tube at 110° with alcohol saturated at zero degrees with
dry hydrogen selenide and dry ammonia. After five hours, the
tube was taken out and the quinazoline crystallized out on cooling.
Yield was about sixteen per cent.</p>

<p>As hydrogen selenide was somewhat unstable and did not dissolve
freely in alcohol, freshly prepared sodium selenide was
used in the following method and was found to be more satisfactory.
It was prepared from sodium hydroxide in absolute
alcohol by passing dry hydrogen selenide into the solution for
about three hours. In the beginning and end of the reaction,
nitrogen was used to exclude the oxygen of the air. The selenide
was collected and dried in an atmosphere of nitrogen, and then
in a vacuum, in presence of phosphorus pentoxide. When thus
prepared, sodium selenide was colorless, but on exposure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
air it turns reddish and finally dark colored. The C. P. selenide
on the market was black and was found to be entirely useless.</p>

<p>(c) 20 grams of anthranilic nitrile and fifty grams of sodium
selenide were mixed and heated in a distilling flask in an atmosphere
of nitrogen, and forty grams of acetic anhydride dropped
into the flask very slowly. The temperature was kept at
115° for half an hour and then raised to distill off the acetic acid
formed in the reaction, as the condensation hardly went to completion
in the presence of any trace of acetic acid. The whole process
took an hour and a half. The flask was removed from the oil
bath and, after cooling, dilute alkali was run in, in successive portions,
to dissolve out the quinazoline. Into the clear alkaline
extracts carbon dioxide was bubbled for an hour, and common
salt then added. The precipitate was recrystallized several times
from twenty-five per cent. alcohol. The yield was from twenty
to twenty-five per cent.</p>

<p>(d) 10 grams of anthranilic nitrile, twenty grams of acetic
anhydride, and twenty-five grams of sodium selenide were mixed
in a sealed tube and heated together for three hours and a half at
110°-115°. The condensation product was crystalline when the
tube was cooled to room temperature. The contents of the
tube were extracted with dilute alkali as before, filtered, precipitated
by carbon dioxide, and recrystallized from dilute alcohol.
The yield was not over twenty per cent.</p>

<p>(e) An attempt was made to make o-aminobenzoselenamide,
and from the latter, by treatment with acetic anhydride, to form
the quinazoline, but the yield of the amide was too small to
carry the reaction further.</p>

<p>The substance prepared by the above methods crystallizes
from dilute alcohol in needles or prisms of dark brown color.
It melts at 213.5° (corr.). It dissolves readily in hot alcohol but
on concentration sometimes forms a sticky mass with a peculiar
but not unpleasant odor. It dissolves readily in alkalis and is
slightly soluble in hot benzene and chloroform, but insoluble
in hot water. Crystals purified from (a) were analyzed and
gave the following results:</p>

<h3 id="experiment_2">Analysis of Selenium Organic Compounds</h3>

<p>In the quantitative determination of selenium in quinazoline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the method adapted by Becker and Meyer was found to be quite
satisfactory<a href="#bib_56" class="fnanchor">(56)</a>. Other methods are listed in the bibliography<a href="#bib_57" class="fnanchor">(57)</a>.</p>

<p>In the ultimate analysis of carbon and hydrogen, the ordinary
absolute method was followed with the use of copper
oxide, lead chromate, and lead peroxide in the tube. In the
determination of nitrogen the ordinary absolute method was
also followed excepting that a considerable quantity of specially
prepared lead chromate powder was mixed with the sample in
a number six porcelain boat. This was found to be desirable
when the dinitroselenazole was burned. Selenium dioxide, which
is a solid, seems to be formed in the tube and carried away by the
current of carbon dioxide with some difficulty. In such a case the
analysis usually took four hours after the combustion had actually
started. In the carbon and hydrogen determination selenium dioxide
was easily absorbed in the presence of oxygen gas.</p>

<h3 id="experiment_3">Preparation of 2-Phenylbenzoselenazole</h3>

<p>The first method employed was a modification of the method
described by Fromm and Martin<a href="#bib_58" class="fnanchor">(58)</a>. Method (b) is an adaptation
of the method for preparing benzothiazoles.</p>

<p>(a) Twenty grams of benzanilide was mixed in a pyrex
flask with 160 grams of selenium dust and the flask placed in a
nitrate bath under an air condenser. After heating for an hour
at 220°C., the temperature was raised to 250°C., and kept at
250°-280°C. for sixteen hours. The dark mass was extracted
with hot concentrated HCl, the acid extracts filtered through glass
wool using a hot water funnel. The combined extracts were poured
into a large volume of water when the selenozole precipitated out
immediately; it was recrystallized from alcohol. In some cases it
was necessary to dissolve in hot HCl again and to recrystallize. The
yield was twelve per cent.</p>

<p>The above method has the disadvantage that water is
formed in the reaction and this in turn reacts upon benzanilid
at the higher temperature necessary (as selenium only melts at
217°C.), decomposing the benzanilid into aniline and benzoic acid.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i019b.png" width="600" height="51" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Furthermore benzanilid boils at 160°C. and at such high temperatures
as 250°C. and over some of it is apt to be driven off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) 106 grams of benzaldehyde were heated with 93 grams of
redistilled aniline at 120°C., for two hours or until the solution
was clear. The clear benzalaniline was then poured into 160
grams of selenium dust in a pyrex flask on a sand bath, the flask
being connected with an air condenser as before. In order to
distribute the flame to better advantage over the bath, an air
space was made between the Meker burner and the bath by
introducing a wire gauze. Hydrogen selenide was evolved freely.
Complete reaction took three days. The extraction and recrystallization
were the same as in the former case. The yield was sixty
per cent.</p>

<p>The selenazole crystallizes in colorless long needles, melting
at 117.5°C. (corr.) Fromm and Martin<a href="#bib_58" class="fnanchor">(58)</a> gave the melting
point as 117°C. It is insoluble in water, and in the following
solvents it is lightly soluble in the cold, more easily hot: ether,
methyl alcohol, acetone, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, chloroform,
and nitrobenzene. It is difficultly soluble in ethyl alcohol, ethyl acetate,
and carbon tetrachloride, in the cold, but easily soluble
hot.</p>

<h3 id="experiment_4">Mononitro Derivative</h3>

<p>The mononitro derivative of the selenazole, 6-nitro-2-phenylbenzoselenazole,
was prepared by nitration with nitric
acid at a low temperature:</p>

<p>Twenty-five grams of the selenazole were dissolved in 150
grams of concentrated sulphuric acid, keeping the temperature
below the room temperature until complete solution took place.
It was then cooled on a freezing mixture and a mixture of sulphuric
and nitric acids (previously prepared and cooled by mixing
9.5 grams of nitric and fifteen grams of sulphuric acids)
slowly dropped into it in the course of half an hour, using mechanical
stirring for four hours. The solution was then poured into
two liters of water (ice water), filtered, dried, and recrystallized
from acetic acid, and alcohol with the help of animal charcoal.
The yield was 95 per cent.</p>

<p>This nitro compound crystallizes in flattened needles of a light
yellow color. It melts at 202.4°C. (corr.). It is very insoluble
in water; but soluble in hot acetic acid, acetic anhydride, nitrobenzene,
nitrotoluene, toluene, benzene, alcohol, and difficultly
soluble when cold. The crystals were analyzed and gave the

<h3 id="experiment_5">Monoamino Derivative</h3>

<p>The conversion of mononitro compound to 6-amino-2-phenylbenzoselenazole
was accomplished by the action of tin and
hydrochloric acid as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>30.3 grams of nitro compound were mixed with 42 grams
of twenty mesh tin in a liter flask, immersing the latter in cold
water. 175 cc. of conc. HCl were slowly added to the flask.
In some cases it was necessary to apply initial heating but when
once the reaction started it took place rapidly. After the effervescence
had abated, the flask was heated over a free flame, under a
return condenser, for two hours. The solution usually turned
to a pasty mass, due to the formation of a tin double salt. The
mixture was dissolved in a large volume of water and heated
on a water-bath, the precipitate filtered out, washed, and preserved.
The clear filtrate was treated with concentrated alkali,
in excess, the separated amine collected, washed with water,
dried and recrystallized from alcohol, using bone-black. The
precipitate set aside was treated with strong alkali, the insoluble
residue washed, recrystallized, and added to the main
product. The yield was 75 per cent.</p>

<p>This amine crystallizes from alcohol in fine yellowish needles,
melting at 201.2°-202.3°C (corr.). It is insoluble in water and
ether, difficultly soluble in the hot; and fairly soluble in aniline.

<p>Five grams of the monoamino compound were mixed with
powdered KOH, heated together until the mixture just melted, and
maintained in that state for a few minutes. When the latter had
cooled down to room temperature, cold water was poured over the
mixture. The filtered solution was acidified until no further
precipitate was formed. The precipitate was collected and recrystallized

<p>One gram of this solid was placed in a test tube, provided

<p>Five grams of the monoamino selenazole were heated on a

<h3 id="experiment_9">An Azo Dye</h3>

<p>Five and four tenth grams of the monoamino compound were
dissolved in hot conc. HCl, cooled in ice, and diazotized with
sodium nitrite solution, until starch iodide paper showed excess
nitrous acid. The diazotization was performed in ice, with
mechanical stirring, and required about an hour. The diazo solution
was poured into a solution of 3 grams B-naphthol in 8 grams
of NaOH and 60 cc. of water, while gradually stirring. A very
deep red solution formed. This was acidified with excess HCl,
salted out by NaCl, and crystallized from aniline-alcohol mixture.
In the pure state, it is a deep red powder, with a metallic lustre
when rubbed, melting at 284.2°C. An analysis showed the following
result,</p>

<h3 id="experiment_10">Dinitro Derivative</h3>

<p>The nitration for the production of dinitro derivative was
at first carried out under the same conditions as in the preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of mononitro compound and after the latter was formed more nitric
acid mixture was added with the addition of heat:
conc. sulphuric acid, keeping it below room temperature. It was
then cooled in a freezing mixture and half the volume of a nitric
acid mixture (prepared and cooled by mixing 19 grams of nitric and
30 grams of sulphuric acids) was introduced very slowly to the
selenazole solution through a dropping funnel, maintaining at this
temperature for two hours (using mechanical stirring). The remaining
half of the nitric acid mixture was then slowly introduced
and the flask was heated on a water-bath for two hours. The solution
was poured into two liters of water, the precipitate filtered off,
dried and recrystallized several times from acetic acid. The yield
was 80 per cent.</p>

<p>This dinitro compound crystallizes in fine yellow needles,
m. p., 246.8°C. (corr.), very insoluble in water, but soluble in
hot acetic acid, acetic anhydride, nitrobenzene, nitrotoluene,
ethyl alcohol, and difficultly soluble cold. It was analyzed and
the following results were found,</p>

<p>The conversion of the dinitro to diamino derivative was accomplished
in the same manner as the reduction of the mononitro
derivative excepting that twice as much tin and HCl were used.</p>

<p>This diamino compound crystallizes in yellowish glistening
needles from alcohol and pyridine; m. p., 269°-270.5°C.; was
analyzed and gave the following results,</p>

<p>The diacetyl and dibenzylidene compounds were also prepared
from these diamino derivatives. The former crystallizes in
cubes from dilute alcohol; m. p., 307°C (Corr.) and the latter in
beautiful yellow plates from carbon disulphide, m. p., 195°-196°C.

<h3 id="experiment_13">Dyeing with Azo Dyes</h3>

<p>Both the monoamino and the diamino derivatives form intensely
colored dyes when diazotized and coupled with phenols
and aromatic amines. The dyes formed are fast to light. In
the following table silk is given to represent the fabrics used.
Wool and cotton were dyed similar shades, though with slight
variation. Each silk sample was dyed in acid or alkaline baths as
indicated and each bath contained 0.01 gram in twenty cc. solution:</p>
